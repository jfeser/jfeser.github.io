      <p>
        I am an Assistant Professor at <a href="https://www.hamilton.edu/academics/departments/Computer-Science">Hamilton College</a>. I received my Undergraduate and Master's degrees from <a href="http://www.rice.edu/">Rice University</a>, where I worked with <a href="https://www.cs.rice.edu/~sc40/">Swarat Chaudhuri</a> and my PhD from MIT, where I worked with <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/asolar/">Armando Solar Lezama</a>.
      </p>
      <p>My research interests are in automated program synthesis and performance engineering, with a focus on synthesizing high performance software that is specialized to a workload.

        <p><b>Instructor, <a href="https://people.csail.mit.edu/feser/">MIT 6.S050</a></b>. Spring 2023. Building a new course on programming language design, along with Armando Solar-Lezama and Michael Carbin!</p>
        <p><b>Recitation Instructor, <a href="http://web.mit.edu/6.033/www/">MIT 6.033</a></b>. Spring 2021, 2022. Responsible for teaching two twice-weekly sections. In each class, students discuss an influential paper from the field of computer systems. These classes make extensive use of active learning techniques to augment traditional lecture based instruction.</p>
        <p><b><a href="https://tll.mit.edu/programming/grad-student-programming/kaufman-teaching-certificate-program/">Kaufman Teaching Certificate Program</a></b>. Spring 2022. Completed a semester-long workshop program on teaching techniques, including course design and evidence-based methods of instruction.</p>
        <p><b>Course Development, <a href="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-820-fundamentals-of-program-analysis-fall-2015/">MIT 6.820</a></b>. Fall 2021. Developed two new problem sets for Fundamentals of Program Analysis; one problem set on verification and loop invariants and one on abstract interpretation. 6.820 is an upper level programming languages course that gives students a practical introduction to program analysis. Grading is based entirely on six problem sets that students complete during the course.</p>
